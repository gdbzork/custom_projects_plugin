# Custom Projects Redmine Plugin

Allows Redmine users to see a personalized list of projects, useful if your Redmine instance has a lot of projects.

There is not much to this plugin.  A link on the top menu named "MyProjects" leads to a page showing a user-customizable list of Redmine projects.  The "Edit" button allows the user to choose which projects should appear on their list.
